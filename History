BDD History

10-02-2010:
	The library was originally created as part of a web framework called
	Rooting Tootin. It contained basic "describe" and "it" functionality
	of Behavior Driven Development. It was heavily inspired by the Ruby
	library Shoulda:

09-20-2011:
	The library was extracted from Rooting Tootin, and put into a smaller
	library called D Language Helper. It was updated to work with both of
	the D core libraries Phobos and Tango:

01-16-2013:
	The library replaced "assert" style tests with "should" style tests:

02-20-2017:
	The Behavior Driven Development elements were extracted from
	D Language Helper and put into their own library called BDD. The
	library was cleaned up to work with Phobos (no more Tango), and made
	to work with the Dub packaging system:
